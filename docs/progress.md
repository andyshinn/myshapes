# Myshapes Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Myshapes project - an Astro website for displaying Onshape CAD documents with a CLI PDF generator tool.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Set up the monorepo workspace structure and basic project foundation

- [x] **1.1** Convert to workspace structure in root package.json
- [x] **1.2** Create packages directory structure
  - [x] `packages/onshape-client/`
  - [x] `packages/shared-types/`
- [x] **1.3** Initialize generator CLI directory structure
- [x] **1.4** Set up Astro content collections with Zod schemas
- [x] **1.5** Configure environment variables for Onshape API

### Phase 2: Shared Packages ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement the core Onshape API client and shared TypeScript types

- [x] **2.1** Implement Onshape client package
  - [x] Request signing authentication
  - [x] Document metadata fetching
  - [x] Thumbnail retrieval
  - [x] PDF upload functionality
- [x] **2.2** Create shared types package
  - [x] Onshape API response types
  - [x] Document metadata interfaces
  - [x] Content collection schemas

### Phase 3: CLI PDF Generator ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create the command-line tool for generating and uploading PDFs, and syncing data from Onshape

- [x] **3.1** Set up CLI structure with Commander.js
- [x] **3.2** Implement core commands
  - [x] `sync` - Sync document metadata from Onshape to Astro content
  - [x] `generate` - Create PDFs from Typst templates  
  - [x] `upload` - Upload PDFs to Onshape documents
  - [x] `bulk-sync` - Process multiple documents from config file
  - [x] `bulk-generate` - Generate PDFs for multiple documents
- [x] **3.3** Create Typst templates
  - [x] Assembly documentation template
  - [x] Part specification template  
  - [x] Drawing documentation template
- [x] **3.4** Document configuration system
  - [x] JSON configuration file for document lists
  - [x] Support for Onshape URLs and document IDs
  - [x] URL parsing utilities

### Phase 4: Astro Website ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Build a two-page website: index of all models + individual model pages

- [x] **4.1** Configure content collections
  - [x] Test with real Onshape data from CLI sync
  - [x] Validate Zod schemas with actual data
- [x] **4.2** Build core UI components
  - [x] Document cards for index page (DaisyUI cards)
  - [x] Model detail components for individual pages
  - [x] Thumbnail display with fallbacks and local preprocessing
  - [x] Version timeline component (DaisyUI Timeline - vertical)
  - [x] Label badges component with hash-based consistent coloring
- [x] **4.3** Implement pages
  - [x] **Index page** (`/`) - Responsive grid of all models with thumbnails and labels
    - [x] Badge display for document labels (filters out "indexed" meta label)
    - [x] Clickable images and titles linking to detail pages
    - [x] 4-column responsive layout (xl:grid-cols-4)
  - [x] **Model pages** (`/[documentId]/`) - Individual document details with:
    - [x] PDF download links (when available)
    - [x] Hero image display with Astro Image optimization
    - [x] Technical metadata (creation date, versions, author info)
    - [x] Label badges with consistent colors
    - [x] Version history timeline (DaisyUI Timeline)
    - [x] Onshape direct link

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Goal**: Set up automated deployment and testing

- [ ] **5.1** GitHub Actions workflow for website deployment
- [ ] **5.2** Environment secrets configuration
- [ ] **5.3** Automated testing setup

## Current Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-23
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Astro Website (completed)
**Next Milestone**: Phase 5 - CI/CD Pipeline or additional enhancements

## Outstanding Issues & Future Work

### üîç Investigation Required

**PDF Upload 502 Error** (Priority: Medium)
- **Issue**: New PDF uploads failing with 502 Bad Gateway error from AWS ELB
- **Affected Document**: Voltaic Enclosures SVR / MCSBC (document: `78a91e01ab367e357347b1a3`)
- **Details**: 
  - Existing PDF updates work fine (200 OK)
  - New PDF creation fails with 502 after ~15 seconds
  - Error comes from `awselb/2.0`, not Onshape directly
  - File size: 3.98 MB (similar to working uploads)
- **Workaround**: Added `skipPdfUpload: true` flag to document metadata
- **Debug Info**: Full HTTP request/response logging available with `--debug` flag
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Test with smaller PDF file sizes
  - Try manual upload through Onshape UI to same document
  - Check if workspace has specific restrictions
  - Consider retry logic with exponential backoff

## Notes

- Project started with basic Astro + Tailwind setup
- Comprehensive technical plan available in `docs/plan.md`
- Using monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Custom Onshape API client due to maintenance issues with existing libraries
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting HTTP requests
- Astro website fully functional with local image preprocessing and authentication fixes
- Site features configurable name via environment variables and responsive design
- Badge component uses hash-based color mapping for consistent label styling
